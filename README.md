# CmdChat

### CmdChat is a *command line interface chat room application* where users can socialize with others right in the terminal!

Implemented in C++, this project has a focus on lower-level network programming, multithreading, and OOP.

The broader purpose of this project is to go through the full motions of development and practice designing maintainable, decoupled code. 
This is done by taking a **test-driven development** approach, where user requirements are broken into smaller pieces of testable functionality and 
the system is designed at a high level. Tests are created from this information before any actual implementation is done. 
Only after the tests are running, coding begins.
